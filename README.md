# QF621-Quant_Strat
Quant Strat project on a more contemporary approach of running a pair trading strategy

What was unique about this project is that it was more dynamic. We started with a universe of tradable commodity futures and used unsupervised learning algos as well as cointegration packages for selection of pairs. Once, we have selected the pairs we ran different trading models and back-tested them.
